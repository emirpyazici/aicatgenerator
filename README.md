# DCGAN CIFAR-10 Cat Image Generator
This repository contains a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset to generate cat images. The project employs TensorFlow and Keras to construct and train the GAN, showcasing the potential of neural networks in generating novel images.

Technologies and Libraries Used:
Python: The primary programming language used for this project.
TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning library used for training the deep learning models.
Keras: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and running on top of TensorFlow.
CIFAR-10: A dataset used in this project, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images in each class.
